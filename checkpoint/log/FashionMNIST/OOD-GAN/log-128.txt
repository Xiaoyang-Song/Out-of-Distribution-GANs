compilation terminated.

[KeOps] Warning : 
    The location of Cuda header files cuda.h and nvrtc.h could not be detected on your system.
    You must determine their location and then define the environment variable CUDA_PATH,
    either before launching Python or using os.environ before importing keops. For example
    if these files are in /vol/cuda/10.2.89-cudnn7.6.4.38/include you can do :
      import os
      os.environ['CUDA_PATH'] = '/vol/cuda/10.2.89-cudnn7.6.4.38'
