# SEE-OOD: Supervised Exploration for Enhanced Out-of-Distribution Detection

This repository contains the official implementation for the paper "SEE-OoD: Supervised Exploration for Enhanced Out-of-Distribution Detection". In particular, this repository provides source code and commands for reproducing results for comparison experiments (Section 5) and numerical examples (Section 4). For the case study in the paper, we provide the source code for model architecture and training but not the actual dataset we used. However, the case study dataset can be requested via email to the authors.

### Keywords: Machine Learning, Out-of-Distribution Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), etc.
